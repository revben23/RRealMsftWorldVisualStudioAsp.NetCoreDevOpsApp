<h4>Some of the completion are:</h4>

</article>

<h5>Pricing</h5>


    Google G-Suite is known for its cheap pricing plans. The plans are Basic which is for $5/user/month that provides all the services above with 30 GB of cloud storage. The next plan Business for $10/user/month. It offers unlimited storage unless there are less than 5 users on the plan. The last plan is Enterprise that offers everything in the Business plan plus security and other enterprise-focused services. It costs $25/user/month. All these plans are offered to unlimited users.


<h5> Comparison</h5>

    There are no like for like Office 365 and G-Suite plans, so a direct comparison is not possible. The closest plans are the E1 to Google Business plan and E3 to Google Enterprise plan. The E1 and Business plans offer very similar services, however, the E1 is cheaper. However, the Business plan offers unlimited storage if there are more than 5 users. This makes them awash. However, when comparing the Enterprise and E3 plans, it is clear to see that the E1 offers more for less when you take into account that it is cheaper while offering the same services with the addition of the desktop versions of Office, on up to five PCs.
    Despite, the reputation of Suite being cheap for business, it is no cheaper than Office 365.

<h3>Zoho Office Suite</h3>

    Zoho Office Suite main plan is called One. It can be had for $35/user/month billed monthly or $30/user/month billed annually. One is the all-in-one platform from Zoho, that offers everything for one price and one interfere. It is similar to Office 365 in the way it is implemented. It defers from Office 365 because it has only one plan and it offers Customer Relationship Management and Financial applications in the package. Each component can be bought individually, and each has a free option.
<br />
<br />
    It compares very to Office 365. I really love what they are doing. That is why I argue that it should be one of the companies Microsoft should buy next.
<br />

<h3> Quip</h3>


    Quip is a collaborative productive service that is currently owned by Salesforce.com. The core of Quip provides word processing and spreadsheet functionality, accessible via the Web, an iOS app, and an Android app. Alongside all documents on Quip is a live updating history of edits made, as well as the ability to highlight portions of a document and add comments, which facilitates collaboration. Quip also has a chat based communication platform as well as what they call Live Apps, which are apps that gives additional functionality to the core platform.
<br />
<br />

    It also has tight integration with Salesforce.com and other productivity platforms such as Google G-Suite.
<br />
<br />

    It can be had for $30/month for the first five users, with an additional $10 needed for each additional user when billed monthly and $12 when billed yearly. There is also an enterprise plan that comes with the usual enterprise-focused plans such as added security and compliance tools. It will cost a company 25/user/month
<br />
<br />

    On its own, it was not a real threat to Office 365, but given that it has been bought by Salesforce.com, it has become a bigger threat. It no longer has to worry about making a profit and it will be pushed by one of the top SaaS companies in the world.
